Few months ago, I was just minding my own business, trying to keep out of trouble,
and came across [Open Source projects from NASA](https://code.nasa.gov/#/). 😻
It was clear that I needed a [Slackbot](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-An-introduction-to-Slackbot)
to sprinkle some space dust around. ✨✨

On some days, my dear [Nasa Slackbot](https://github.com/mimimalizam/nasa)
will gladly share a picture of the day from [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod)
and its description - when nicely asked.

Two days later, first Open Source contribution made my day.

So, there I was - sitting in front of the screen - and suddenly realised that
it's been 15 years since my first [Petnica](http://petnica.rs/) visit.
That year, I met some awesome folks and learned few things about universe during
the Astronomy track. Today Petnica takes a special place in my heart, and
I'm happy to realize that some course attendants are still part of my everyday life.
Nostalgia.. that weird thing.
