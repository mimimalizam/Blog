Formally educated in theoretical mathematics, and not afraid to use it. Curios and compassionate by nature. Always trying to find cause in things she does. Likes solving logical puzzles. Enjoys playing strategy-based games and reading, mostly about utopian and fictional worlds. She finds herself easily motivated and moment-driven, so she canâ€™t tell where she could easily be found. An enthusiastic O'Reilly Radar and R. J. Lipton reader.
